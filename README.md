# stalker-uav
Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and UAV teams are employed for disaster relief/rescue missions; piloting and monitoring the mission at the same time is a demanding/critical task. The UAV autonomously tracks and maintains all the rescue vehicles within its field of view with minimal power consumption; improving the sensory awareness of the first responders.
